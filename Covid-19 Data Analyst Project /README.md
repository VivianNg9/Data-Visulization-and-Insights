# COVID-19 in Australia: Data-Driven Insights for Public Health Decisions

This project focuses on using public data to analyze and understand the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and its global context. It provides actionable insights to inform health policy and strategic decision-making. Key methodologies include descriptive analysis, clustering, correlation studies, hypothesis testing, and vaccination impact assessment.
### Key Features:
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Charts the pandemic's progression globally and in Australia, identifying critical waves, the role of variants like Delta and Omicron, and vaccination campaign impacts.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Groups countries based on pandemic characteristics using K-Means, highlight differences in Covid-19 response and socioeconomic factors.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examines relationships between Australia's pandemic trends and other countries, identifying significant correlations with European nations.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Evaluates the impact of Australia's strict health policies, showing a limited but notable influence on reducing transmission rates.
- **Vacination Impact**: Demonstrates the critical role of vaccinations in reducing mortality rates and improving health outcomes through advanced statistical methods like XGBoost and OLS regression.
- Comprehensive descriptive analysis of global and Australian COVID-19 trends.


### Technical Tools and Technologies:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
  - Statistical Analysis: SciPy, Statsmodels
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
