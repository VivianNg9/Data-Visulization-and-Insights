# World Development Indicators: Exploratory Study

This project analyses the "World Development Indicators" dataset to uncover economic drivers of GDP per capita growth over 50 years for 20 countries. The analysis evaluates economic development, monetary policies, and forecasting methods to provide actionable insights for policymakers.

### Key Objectives:
- Identify key factors contributing to economic growth and development.
- Understand the role of monetary policies in improving economic outcomes.
- Develop models to forecast GDP per capita growth and assess policy impacts.

### Key Findings:
- **Health Expenditure**: Identified as the primary driver of GDP per capita growth.
- **Economic Segmentation**: The Global North/South classification is less effective than Human Development Index-based segmentation.
- **Forecast Accuracy**: ARIMA models achieved 95% confidence in GDP growth predictions for the next three years.

## Methodologies and Tools

### Methodologies:
- **Descriptive Analytics**: Trends in inflation, agricultural land use, and labor contribution.
- **Multilinear Regression**: Identified health expenditure and infrastructure as key predictors of GDP.
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicted economic development classification with 95% accuracy.
- **Forecasting**: Used ARIMA models for future GDP growth.

### Technical Tools:
- **Data Preparation**: Microsoft Excel for cleaning and pre-processing.
- **Data Analytics**: SAS Visual Analytics for advanced modeling.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
- **Visualization**: Charts for trends in GDP, labor, and land use.
